# Cartoon2Real-Image-Conversion
This project focuses on converting cartoonish images to realistic images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The implementation involves training a GAN model on a dataset of cartoonish drawings and their corresponding real photos, followed by evaluating the model's performance using both qualitative and quantitative metrics.
